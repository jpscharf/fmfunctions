 * @author: Jason P. Scharf <jason.scharf@intergrated.net>
 * 
 * @changelog: v1.0.0, 2018-03-02, Added.
 *
 * @description: Returns only the name of the field prefixed with the table,
 *   as opposed to GetFieldName() which also returns the relationship. This is 
 *   to be used in SQL queries to protect the field references from breaking if
 *   the field is renamed. The Quote() function "escapes" problematical
 *   characters and SQL reserved words, if any -- otherwise, no harm done.
 *
 * @example: GFFN (table::field)  --> "Table"."Field"
